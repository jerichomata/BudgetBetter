### Overview

Welcome to Plaid's Tiny Quickstart! This repo contains two folders: **vanilla_js/** and **react/**. Each folder contains a minimal app that implements Plaid. The app in the **vanilla_js/** folder uses a vanilla JS front end and a Node/Express backend, while the app in the **react/** folder uses a React front end an a Node/Express backend. Both apps implement Plaid Link, the Balance product, and OAuth.

To get started, clone the repository, `cd` into one of the folders, and follow the instructions in the corresponding **README**. Enjoy! 

```
git clone https://github.com/plaid/tiny-quickstart.git && cd /tiny-quickstart
```

If you're looking for a more fully-featured quickstart, covering more API endpoints, available in more languages, and with explanations of the underlying flows, see the official [Plaid Quickstart](https://www.plaid.com/docs/quickstart).
