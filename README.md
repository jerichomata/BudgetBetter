# BudgetBetter 

BudgetBetter is a bank account visualizer developed to help individuals manage their money. This web application was developed for the hackCWRU-2022 hackathon. The project finished in 1st place in the Fintech track. This web application is developed with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. The backend is hosted by Express. The web application utilizes the Plaid API, where bank account information is linked to various accounts. We utilized the Plaid sandbox, where we were able to create custom users with custom data, in order to demo our application. The Plaid API retrieves bank information from the sandbox, allowing us to display it visually for the user.
