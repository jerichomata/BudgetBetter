# README: BudgetBetter 

### Overview

We developed this web application for the hackCWRU-2022 hackathon. The project finished in 1st place in the Fintech track. This web application is developed with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. The backend is hosted by Express. The web application utilizes the Plaid API, where bank account information is linked to various accounts. We utilized the Plaid sandbox, where we were able to create custom users with custom data, in order to demo our application. The Plaid API retrieves bank information from the sandbox, allowing us to display it visually for the user.

#### Start the application

You can run npm install in order to install the needed dependencies. From there, you can run npm start to start the server. The app runs on port 8080.

### Using the app

After clicking get started, you can enter the provided login information from the get started page in order to login to the Plaid API.
